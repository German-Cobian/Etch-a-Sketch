# "Etch-a-Sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Upon loading the web browser window, a popup will appear asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.

Once a number is entered, a new grid is generated that constitutes the new sketch pad.
The grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
